# 🧀 The Cheezits FTC Swerve Drive Code

Welcome to the official repository for **The Cheezits FTC Team's** swerve drive robot code.  
This is the software powering their 2024 season robot, featuring a fully functional swerve drive system built on top of the FTC SDK.

---

## ⚠️ Status

> ⚙️ **Note:**  
> The code is still under development and has **not yet been tested on the real robot**, as the hardware team is currently working on building the swerve modules and drivetrain.

---

## ✨ Features (Work In Progress)

- ✅ Full swerve drive system for FTC robots
- ✅ TeleOp OpMode with field-oriented control (IMU-based)
- ✅ Autonomous framework ready for future pathing
- ✅ Configurable hardware mapping
- ✅ Utility functions for calibration and debugging
- ✅ Modular, readable, and extendable structure
- ⚠️ Testing & Tuning pending until hardware is completed
